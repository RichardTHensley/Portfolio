## Projects

### Excel VBA Descriptive Statistics Project
**Description of the project** Using data on College Attendance Rates for each state in the USA to show data summary and descriptive statistics using VBA macros to import the data from CSV and then carry out descriptive statistics  
Take data from two different CSV files and concat them into one Excel sheet using the 'Get Data' button on the main page sheet.
Then, create the data summary sheet with relevant descriptive statistics gathered from our data.

**Technologies Used:** Microsoft Excel, Excel macro editor, and VBA

### Python Dashboard Project
**Description of the project** Using the same College Attendance Rate dataset as the VBA project, this project required the import of our two data files, the merging of those two files, and creating a report to answer sample business questions, and then the creation of an interactive menu that carries out several different statistical analysis on the data set. This required multiple different functions to be coded to be used by the menu function (HistBuilder: builds histogram charts based on an input value; DescStats: outputs the descriptive statistics of the variables given an input value; RegBuilder: runs multiple regression models based off dependant variables; ScatterMaker: builds multiple scatterplot diagrams based on an input value).

**Challenges:** This project required making functions that work with various variables from our data set. This meant that the Python functions are all hard-coded to specific inputs, which means this code will only work on the College Attendance data set.

**Technologies Used:** Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, and numpy packages  

### Peak Performance Data Base
**Description of the project** Working in a team to design a membership tracking database for a hypothetical gym opening in the Denver Metro Area to learn about Data Warehousing techniques. Using an existing OLTP Database, we conducted an extract transfer and load program, using Visual Studios, to construct a new data mart to contain our data. Once the new data mart was created, we conducted multidimensional analysis using PowerPivot and PowerBI to visualize our data. 

**Challenges:** This project was colabritive with a parter, and as such, we often shared files with new updates to our code. Keeping files organized and up to date with my Partner took up much of our time working on this project. This lead us to using a set format for file changes and specific locations in our main DM folder to keep things organiazed. 

**Technologies Used:** Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Basics, PowerPivot, and PowerBI
